            OpenLife is an open-source productivity and time-management project focused on helping individuals understand how they
            spend their time and how they can improve their daily workflow through reflection and data-driven insights.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            The core idea behind OpenLife is simple: most people stay busy but lack clarity. OpenLife aims to bridge this gap by
            allowing users to track daily activities, analyze time usage patterns, and make small, consistent improvements over time.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Instead of being just another task tracker, OpenLife emphasizes awareness, analysis, and gradual improvement. It is
            designed to capture not only what tasks are done, but also how time flows throughout the day, helping users identify
            distractions, inefficiencies, and productivity leaks.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            The project is built with a clean, API-driven and modular architecture, making it easy to extend, scale, and experiment
            with new ideas. It is intentionally kept beginner-friendly so that students, freshers, and new open-source contributors
            can learn real-world development practices while building something meaningful.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            OpenLife is community-driven by design. Contributors are encouraged to participate not only through code, but also by
            proposing ideas, improving documentation, refining workflows, and shaping the long-term vision of the project together.
